# The Nature of Code: A Port to p5.js

The Nature of Code is a book by Daniel Shiffman about simulating natural processes with the programming lanaguge Processing. While ports to p5.js already exist (and I believe Mr. Shiffman himself is updating the book to use p5.js), I hope to use this project both as a way to learn the material present in the book and as an exercise in porting between languages. P5.js has a very similar vocabulary to Processing, and I hope that the porting will be relatively painless. 

## Status

This is **very much** a work in progress. Right now, I'm focusing on putting all of the sketches online. After that, I plan to add interactivity and fill in some useful information that expands on the book's text.
